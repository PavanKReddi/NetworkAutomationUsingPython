# NetworkAutomationUsingPython
The idea was inspired from ClosedFlow: OpenFlow-like Control over Proprietary Devices, which allows enterprises to control the network through a centralized controller by using Python scripts, which is able to send and receive configurations and information from all managing boxes in the network without entering authentication information to login to each box. The program requires an MS Excel file that contains authentication information of the managing boxes including Name, IP address, Username, and Password.
